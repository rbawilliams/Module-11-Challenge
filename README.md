# Project: Mercado Libre (Forecasting Net Prophet) 

![Alt text](11-challenge-image.png)

## Project Overview:
MercadoLibre is the leading e-commerce platform in Latin America with over 200 million users. In this project, we aim to analyze financial and user data in innovative ways to drive revenue growth for the company. To achieve this goal, we have created a Jupyter notebook that includes data preparation, analysis, and visualizations of time series data that is crucial for the company to understand.

The Jupyter notebook contains visual depictions of seasonality as measured by Google Search traffic, an evaluation of the correlation between the company's stock price and its search traffic, a Prophet forecast model that can predict hourly user search traffic, and answers to the questions in the instructions. Additionally, we have also included a plot of a forecast for the company's future revenue (optional).

The code and documentation for this project can be found in this GitHub repository. The Jupyter notebook is well-documented using text and comments to explain our findings and methodology. The code is organized and well-commented, making it easy for others to understand and build upon our work.

This project provides valuable insights into MercadoLibre's financial and user data, which can be used to inform key business decisions and drive revenue growth for the company. We hope that this GitHub repository serves as a valuable resource for our team and other stakeholders.

## Key Features:
Analysis of the relationship between Google Search traffic and MercadoLibre's stock price
Data preparation, analysis, and visualization of time-series data
A Prophet forecast model to predict hourly user search traffic
Summary of findings in a README.md file

## Technologies Used:
- Google Colab
- Jupyter Notebook
- Python libraries such as hvPlot and Prophet

## Usage:
The repository can be used to find unusual patterns in hourly Google Search traffic and to relate the search traffic to stock price patterns. It also provides the steps to create a time series model using Prophet and forecast the revenue (optional).
